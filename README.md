# 🛠️ FileTools  
**FileTools** is a simple yet powerful graphical tool (GUI) that allows you to convert files between multiple formats with ease. It supports DOCX to PDF, TXT, and HTML; PPTX to PDF; PDF duplication and merging; and image format conversion between JPG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF.

• Merge multiple PDF files into one with a custom name  
• Organizes output files into separate folders by format
